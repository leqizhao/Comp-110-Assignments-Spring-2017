I downloaded the data from "http://tiny.cc/dcf/Library-small.rda".

#  Basics

```{r}
load("Library-small.rda")
```

```{r}
nrow(Inv)
nrow(Bks)
names(Inv)
names(Bks)
```

```{r}
Inv %>%
  group_by(Current.Status) %>%
  tally()
```

```{r}
Inv %>%
  group_by(Issued.Count) %>%
  tally()
```

5 means that we count the total number of books for different status. 6 means that we count the total number of books for different issues.
